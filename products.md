## ESA-CCI PASSIVE PRODUCT

The 10-day composite constructed by means of the daily data (Guido's composite) does not match the 10-day composite available through C3S (Copernicus' composite).

Two main differences:

- data value (the Copernicus' composite is the average of the daily data? Check it)
- spatial gaps (the Copernicus' composite seems to be gap-filled, large areas with missing values in Guido's composites have values in the corresponding Copernicus' composite)
